The purpose of this website is to rent books for 7 days through the admin panel.<br>
There are not many functions for the user panel because this website actually only focuses on the functions and UI of the admin panel. The UI of this project is almost all responsive under 800px screen<br>
Demo : https://bookrents.000webhostapp.com<br>
